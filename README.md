- [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) to download youtube videos (if `mpv_mode` is disabled)
- [omxplayer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/omxplayer.md) or [vlc](https://www.videolan.org) or [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu) or [mpv](http://mpv.io) to play videos

# installing

You can download a self-contained binary from [releases page](https://github.com/yazgoo/youtube-subscriptions/releases)
